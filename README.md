## Information
- This project is to predict if the patient has hepatitis or not.
- The ML model has an accuracy up to 88%.
- We used logistic regression model.
- Logistic regression : is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. so we use logistic regression as we need to know if the patient has hepatitis or not.

## Web 
- First page as we descripe the ML model, accuracy and senstivity.

- Second page as we ask some question to collect some information from the patient (like:name, age, ) to predict the disease.
